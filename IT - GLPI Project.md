# Project Context

As part of the continued development of its architecture, the IT department of Coll√®ge de Rosemont would like to improve the services provided by its IT asset management software (GLPI).

Our mandate for this project iwas to carry out an analysis of the needs and the impact of adding the different functionalities that were requested.

Depending on the result of the analysis, you will be called upon to configure a GLPI server in a test environment (your own environment) in such a way as to meet the needs of the department, represented by Bertrand Xayasane ("Project Owners").

To complete this project, we used the SCRUM project management approach.

# Project Objectives

## Documentation Objectives

- Create a **project charter**
- Create a **product backlog**
- Provide the **SCRUM master schedule** from the start of the project to the end of the project

## Product Objectives

- The software should be able to inventory at minimum the following elements:
  -  All types of network equipment in the IT department using the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) protocol
  -  All type 1 hypervisors using GLPI
  -  All Windows and Linux computers using agents in client-server relationship mode
 
- A ticketing system that resembles a service catalog that has a functional email notification system

- An equipment reservation system

- Integrated APIs
